A small StepMania cabinet designed to be played index-style, using arcade buttons and a Raspberry Pi 4.

I made this cabinet in around a month's worth of time, including waiting for parts shipping and debugging and figuring stuff out in general. I'm sure you can make it much faster, provided you get everything in time and have a bit more experience than I do in coding. This will be a comprehensive guide on how to make everything. Even if you haven't touched Linux or a Raspberry Pi before, this should cover all of the steps to making one of these.

## Tools you'll need
1. A computer with a MicroSD reader 
2. A glue gun or superglue
3. A drill with an M4 drill bit
4. A proper crimping tool for crimp connectors
5. A screw driver or hex wrench (dependent on the kind of screws you have)
6. A 3D printer with a sizeable print bed. (Any size will work, but a CR-10 300x300x400 style printer will work the best.)
7. Wire cutters
### Optional but reccomended tools
1. A soldering iron
2. A crimp tool for crimping Dupont connectors

## Required Materials
1. Raspberry Pi 4B, 4GB version
2. Two to three spools of 3D Printer filament of your choice. 
3. 32gb MicroSD card (You can go as low as 8GB to install everything, but if you want more than 3 songs on your cabinet, you'll want a high capacity card.)
4. 2x CWB-406 Arcade Buttons (Chinese clones are fine as long as the buttons are 33x33mm)
5. 8x CWB-408 Arcade Buttons (do NOT use chinese clones for these, I cannot guarantee that the dimensions will match.)
6. Multiple M4 screws and bolts of varying size. Pan-head reccomended. 
7. USB sound card that is compatible with a Raspberry Pi.
8. .250 and .187 Crimp Connectors
9. 24 gauge wire
10. Speakers of any kind
11. 1024x900 7" Raspberry Pi Screen (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32314647847.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3d324c4d7BuPCg)
12. HDMI to microHDMI cable
13. USB-C cable
# Optional materials
1. Arcade Button Lamps
2. 115 x 281mm Polycarbonate Sheet (any thickness)
3. Print-safe Vinyl
4. White Vinyl
5. WS2812B LED strip
6. 50mm Diameter Speaker
7. Speaker Amp Board
8. Arduino Pro Micro (2x)
9. Dupont Connectors

## Getting Started
Gotta write this eventually...
